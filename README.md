### How It Works

Doodle Dragon leverages the following technologies:

* **Flutter:** For building a beautiful and responsive user interface.
* **Google Gemini:** A powerful multimodal AI model that analyzes images and text to generate creative content.
* **OpenAI API (Optional):** Used for text-to-image generation, allowing kids to bring their spoken ideas to life.
* **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech:**  Makes the app accessible and engaging for young children.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**  You will need a Flutter development environment set up.
2. **API Keys:**
    * Obtain a Gemini API key from Google Cloud Platform.
    * (Optional) Get an OpenAI API key for expanded image generation features.
3. **Clone the Repository:**  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/doodle-dragon.git`
4. **Install Dependencies:** `flutter pub get`
5. **Configure API Keys:** Create a dotenv file from dotenv.template and fill the keys.
6. **Run the App:** `flutter run`



**Currently tested only on Android Phones and Tablets with API level 33 and above**

### Configuration

The app can be customized through the settings screen:

* **General Settings:**
    * **Learner Name:** Used to personalize interactions with the child.
    * **Learner Age:** Helps the AI models tailor content appropriately.
* **API Keys:**
    * **Gemini API Key:** Your Google Gemini API key.
    * **OpenAI API Key:** Your OpenAI API key (optional).

* **Set Up Firebase Authentication:**

    * Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
    * Add your app to the Firebase project and download the google-services.json file.
    * Place the google-services.json file in the android/app directory.
    * Enable the sign-in methods you intend to use (e.g., Google, Apple) in the Firebase Console under Authentication.

* **Generate Firebase Configuration File:**

    * Install the flutterfire_cli tool using dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli.
    * Run flutterfire configure in your project directory. This will generate a lib/firebase_options    * dart file automatically based on your Firebase project settings.

* **Setting Up Firebase Cloud Functions:**

    * Deploy functions using firebase deploy --only functions.
    * Set up API key secrets for secure storage and access.

### Future Enhancements
